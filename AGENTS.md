<!-- OPENWIKI:START -->

## OpenWiki

This repository has a generated `openwiki/` evidence index. It is optional just-in-time context, not required startup reading.

- Do not enumerate, preload, or search wikis at task start. Use retrieval when the user asks for it, when unfamiliar architecture or dependency behavior materially affects the task, or when source inspection leaves an important uncertainty. Stop once the question is grounded.
- When those conditions apply and OpenWiki retrieval tools are available, use `openwiki_search` for just-in-time context and `openwiki_read` for the relevant complete sections. If search returns `workspace_required`, ask which listed workspace to use and retry with its ID.
- Use `openwiki_list_workspaces` or `openwiki_list_wikis` when workspace membership itself needs to be discovered.
- If the retrieval tools are unavailable, read `openwiki/quickstart.md` and follow its links to the relevant pages.
- Treat source code and tests as authoritative. A brief's unknowns and review items are verification gaps, not automatic requirements.
- Prefer the narrowest quiet validation that proves the changed behavior. Preserve complete failure output.

The scheduled OpenWiki GitHub Actions workflow refreshes the repository wiki. Do not hand-edit generated OpenWiki pages unless explicitly asked; prefer updating source code/docs and letting OpenWiki regenerate.

## Architectural decisions

`record_decision` is **not** part of the wired `substrate` surface, so do not plan around calling it.

When making a significant design choice, record it with the CLI **before** writing the code:

```bash
openlore decisions record --title "Use JWTs for stateless auth" --rationale "Avoids session store in infra" \
  --consequences "Tokens can't be revoked early" --files src/auth/middleware.ts
```

To expose the MCP tool as well: `openlore install --preset full`  — then this section regenerates with the MCP workflow.

## When git commit is blocked by the decisions gate

If `git commit` fails and the output is JSON with `"gated": true`, do NOT retry silently.
Check the `reason` field and act accordingly:

**`reason: "verified"` — decisions await review:**
Present each decision to the user:
> "The commit is blocked — I found N architectural decision(s) to validate:
> 1. **[id]** Title — rationale
Do you approve? (yes/no)"
For each approval run `openlore decisions --approve <id>`, for each rejection `openlore decisions --reject <id>` (both work on every MCP preset).
Then run `openlore decisions --sync` and retry `git commit`.

**`reason: "approved_not_synced"` — decisions approved but not written to specs:**
Run `openlore decisions --sync` then retry `git commit`. Do not skip this step.

**`reason: "drafts_pending_consolidation"` — drafts were recorded but not yet consolidated:**
Present to the user:
> "N decision draft(s) were recorded but never consolidated. Run consolidation now? (~10-30s)"
If yes: run `openlore decisions --consolidate --gate` and handle the result.
If no: retry with `git commit --no-verify` to skip the gate.

**`reason: "no_decisions_recorded"` — source files staged but nothing recorded:**
Present to the user:
> "Source files are staged but no architectural decisions were recorded. Run fallback extraction to check for undocumented decisions? (~10-30s)"
If yes: run `openlore decisions --consolidate --gate` and handle the result.
If no: retry with `git commit --no-verify` to skip the gate.
